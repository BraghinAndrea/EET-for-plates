Easy to use Matlab functions to calculate the Effective thichness for laminated plates with polymeric interlayers.
Material and geometric properties properties can be tuned.

- Circular simply supported plated under uniformly distributed load (pressure load)
- Clamped circular plate under uniformly distributed load (pressure load)
- Circular plate undergoing th Ring on Ring test
- Rectangular simply supported laminated plate under uniformly distributed load (pressure load)
